# COMP-401-A11
Final assignment completed in my Foundations of Programming course. It's a program inspired by the Monty Python and the Holy Grail bridge scene.

It consists of a view that depicts the bridge scene with Arthur, the knights, and the guard to the bridge. Commands can be given to Arthur, the knights, and the guard such as Approach, Say, Passed, and Failed and the program will move the characters and display texts accordingly.

My code can be found in the src folder. Within the src folder, the mp folder contains the views and shapes to make up the bridge scene and the grail folder contains models and objects of the program. All other code provided by Professor Prasun Dewan.
